### 1) StringMatching: this class contains methods and algorithms related to find matches between strings and sequences:

-	**Finite Automata Algorithm**. Algorithms to find occurrences of a string within a larger one. Good to use when pattern is small because finite state table computing and size quite small. [ FASearch ]

-	**Boyer Moore Algorithm**. Algorithms to find occurrences of a string within a larger one. Good to use when pattern is big since it requires way less memory than Finite Automata and no need for pre-computed table. [ FASearch ]
