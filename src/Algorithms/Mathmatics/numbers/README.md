___	

### 1) Numbers: this class contains methods and algorithms related to special numbers or properties:

-  **politeness of a number**: the number of ways it can be expressed as the sum of consecutive integers. [ politeness ]
-  **check if number is a Hoax Number**. Hoax number is  a composite number, whose sum of digits is equal to the sum of digits of its distinct prime factors (1 is not included in primes). [ isHoax ]
-  **check if number is a Sphenic Number**. Sphenic Number is a positive integer n which is product of exactly three distinct primes. [ isSphenic ]
-  **get value of catalan number n**. Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that occurs in many interesting [counting problems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/applications-of-catalan-numbers/). [ getCatalan ]
-  **check if number is Smith Number**.Smith Number is a composite number whose sum of digits is equal to the sum of digits in its prime factorization. [isSmith]
-  **get nth Fibonacci number**. Fibonacci number n is the nth number in Fibonacci sequence. [ getFibonacciValue ]

### 2) TotientFunction: this class contains method related to calculate Totient Function and primative roots:
-   **Calculate Totient Value for different queries**. [computeTotientQuery , PrimeTest.primeSieveList]
-   **Calculate Totient Value for all numbers below N**. [computeTotient]
