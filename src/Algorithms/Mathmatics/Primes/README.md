# This Package contains algorithms related to calculating Primes:

## 1) PrimeTest:
	- check if a given number is prime [ isPrime ]
	- check if a given large number is prime [ MillerRabinPrimalityTest ]
	- get all prime numbers under N as list [primeSieveList]
	- get an array that shows which number is prime and which is not under the value N [primeSieveArray]
