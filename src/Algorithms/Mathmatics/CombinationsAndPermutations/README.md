# This package contains methods and algorithms related to Combinations and permutations problems:

___

## 1) Combinations:

-	calculate value of nCr(number of combination that we can create from set n with size of r). [ **nCrBinomialCoeff** ]
-   calculate value of nCr % p (using lucas little theorem). [ **nCrModpLucas** ]

---

## 2) Permutations:

-   calculate value of permutations n,k ( n! / (n-k)! ). [ **PermutationCoeff** ]
