# This Package contains algorithms related to calculating GCD and LCD in different scenarios

------

## 1) Greatest Common Division ( GCD ):
	-	calculate GCD using Euclidean algorithm [ euclideanGCD ]
	-	calculate GCD using Binary Euclidean algorithm, algorithm suitable only for GCD with numbers greater than 10^30 [ binaryEuclideanGCD ]
	-	calculate GCD of more than two (or array) numbers [ arrayGCD ]
	-	calculate GCD of 2 numbers when one of them very large [ largeGCD ]
	-	Product of given N fractions in reduced form ( ex: 1/3 * 2*5 * 10 /11 ....) [ fractionsProductReduce ]
	-	algorithm to make GCD of a given array equals one using Minimum GCD operations [ minimumOpeationsForGCDToEqualOne ]
	-	Replace every matrix element with maximum of GCD of row or column [ replaceMatrixElementsWithMaxGCD ]
	-	GCD of two numbers formed by repeating n x and y times (ex:n,x,y = 12,2,3 -> GCD(1212,121212)) [ findGCDOfNRepeatitions ]
	-	Count number of pairs (A <= N, B <= N) such that gcd (A , B) is B [ countPairsWithGCDEqualsB ]
	-	Given N and M, task is to find whether numbers 1 to N can be divided into two sets such that the absolute difference between the sum of two sets is M and gcd of the sum of two sets is 1 [isSplittable]


## 2) Least common multiplier ( LCM ):
	-	calculate LCM using EuclideanGCD [ lcm ]
	-	calculate LCM of more than two (or array) numbers [ arrayLCM ]
	-	LCM of factorial and its neighbors ( LCM((n-1)!, n!, (n+1)! )) [ neighbourFactorialLCM ]
	-	calculate LCM of rational numbers (ex: 1/3,1/4,1/5...) [ lcmOfFractions ]
	-	Check if LCM of array elements is divisible by a prime number [ isLCMDivisibleByK ]
