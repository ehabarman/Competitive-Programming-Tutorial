# This Package contains algorithms related to calculating GCD and LCD in different scenarios

------

## 1) Greatest Common Division ( GCD ):
	-	calculate GCD using Euclidean algorithm [ euclideanGCD ]
	-	calculate GCD of more than two (or array) numbers [ arrayGCD ]
	-	calculate GCD of 2 numbers when one of them very large [ largeGCD ]
	-	Product of given N fractions in reduced form ( ex: 1/3 * 2*5 * 10 /11 ....) [ fractionsProductReduce ]
	-	algorithm to make GCD of a given array equals one using Minimum GCD operations [ minimumOpeationsForGCDToEqualOne ]
	-	Replace every matrix element with maximum of GCD of row or column [ replaceMatrixElementsWithMaxGCD ]
	-	GCD of two numbers formed by repeating n x and y times (ex:n,x,y = 12,2,3 -> GCD(1212,121212)) [ findGCDOfNRepeatitions ]


## 2) Least common multiplier ( LCM ):
	-	calculate LCM using EuclideanGCD [ lcm ]
	-	calculate LCM of more than two (or array) numbers [ arrayLCM ]
