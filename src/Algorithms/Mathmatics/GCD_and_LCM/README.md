# This Package contains algorithms related to calculating GCD and LCD in different scenarios

------

## 1) Greatest Common Division ( GCD ):
	-	calculate GCD using Euclidean algorithm [ euclideanGCD ]
	-	calculate GCD of more than two (or array) numbers [ arrayGCD ]


## 2) Least common multiplier ( LCM ):
	-	calculate LCM using EuclideanGCD [ lcm ]
	-	calculate LCM of more than two (or array) numbers [ arrayLCM ]
