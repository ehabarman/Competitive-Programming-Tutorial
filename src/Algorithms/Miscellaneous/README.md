# this package contains interesting algorithms and methods that can be used in general with other algorithms
____

1) **Mo's Algorithm**, this algorithm used to perform multiple queries in a certain range. [ **Class MoQueries** ]

2) **Link Cut Tree**. advanced problem with splay tree and tango tree understanding as a requirement. [**clas LinkCutTree**]

3) **Heavy Light Decomposition**. [ **class Heavy Light Decomposition** ] 

4) **Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree)**. This tree structures is made to handle array of n elements where two operations is done. First is to change value of an element in array, second is to find sum of all values from index 0 to given index i. Tree used when multiple queries of change and find sum operations is done in order to reduce total time of query to log n instead of n. [ **FenwickTree**]
